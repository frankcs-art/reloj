## 2025-01-24 - Clipboard Feedback Pattern
**Learning:** In technical configuration panels, providing a "Copy" button with immediate visual feedback (changing text and color) significantly improves the developer experience by confirming the action without requiring a separate notification.
**Action:** Use inline state changes (e.g., button text "Copiar" -> "¡Copiado!") for quick clipboard actions to provide low-friction feedback.
