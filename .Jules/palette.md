**Learning:** In technical configuration panels, providing a "Copy" button with immediate visual feedback (changing text and color) significantly improves the developer experience by confirming the action without requiring a separate notification.
**Action:** Use inline state changes (e.g., button text "Copiar" -> "¡Copiado!") for quick clipboard actions to provide low-friction feedback.

**Learning:** In complex configuration tools, providing a prominent "Reset to Defaults" button encourages user experimentation and reduces "fear of breaking" the UI by offering a safe path back to a known-good state.
**Action:** Implement a Reset button alongside primary actions in configuration panels, using abstract variable names for configurable properties to maintain semantic clarity.
